# Bohemian Fitness: Join Our Tribe, Find Your Vibe

When you walk into Bohemian Fitness, you’ll feel it straight away, this isn’t your typical gym.

It’s a space that hums with earthy energy, warm smiles, and a sense of belonging that settles into your bones.

Here, movement is medicine, strength is sacred, and community is everything.

For the past **five years**, I’ve been building this dream on my own, a wellness space shaped by over **13 years of experience** in the fitness industry and a lifetime surrounded by sports, teams, and the simple joy of movement.

Bohemian Fitness was born from a desire to create a place where real people could train without pressure, without judgement, and without pretending to be anything other than themselves.

I now have a strong team of coaches behind me to help me push this dream to the next level and support so many more people looking to improve their lifestyle and quality of life.

This is a home for the seekers, the doers, the curious, the strong, the healing, and the growing.

A home for you.

## Movement for the Body, Mind & Soul

Our philosophy is simple: fitness should nourish every part of you.

At Bohemian Fitness, we believe in **mind in movement**, training that brings you into your body, into the present moment, and connects you with the strength you already hold.

We pair this with a **structured**, **balanced strength and conditioning programme** designed to help you grow physically while staying grounded mentally and emotionally.

Our classes are intentionally varied so there’s something for every body and every energy:

- ✨**Barbell classes** for building strength and confidence  
- ✨**TRX training** for functional movement and core power  
- ✨**Strength & Conditioning** for all-round athleticism  
- ✨**Cardio sessions** to boost energy and endurance  
- ✨**Mobility classes** to help you move freely and age well  
- ✨**Mums & Babies classes** for postnatal reconnecting, bonding, and gentle rebuilding  
- ✨**Fit For Life classes**, our over 60s functional fitness class, building strength and confidence  
- ✨**Speciality one-to-one classes** for those seeking something deeper, gentler, or more personalised  

Whether you’re experienced or brand new, every class can be tailored to your level.

No pressure.  
No ego.  
Just your journey, your pace, your progress.

## A Community That Understands the Real Struggle

I created Bohemian Fitness not just as a business, but as a beacon for people who want more from their wellness journey.

Living with **narcolepsy** while competing in **weightlifting** has shaped me, through triumphs, setbacks, fatigue, and resilience.

I know what it feels like to train while navigating challenges the world doesn’t always see.

I know what it feels like to need support, understanding, and a space where you don’t have to explain yourself.

That’s why our community is built differently.

- We hold space for every kind of journey  
- We support you in the good days and the hard ones  
- We celebrate your wins, big or small, with genuine joy  

Because fitness isn’t just physical.

It’s human.

And you deserve a place where you can be fully, honestly you.

- **Class blocks** for consistency with freedom

Your goals, your finances, your life, we meet you where you are.
